    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how html elements to be displayed on screen, paper, or in the other media.</li><br>
        <li><b style="text-decoration: line-through;">CSS is not neccesary </b><b><span>CSS saves a lot of work.</span></b> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li><br>
        <li><i style="text-decoration:underline">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</i></li> <br>
    </ol>
    <h3>
       <i> CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i>
    </h3>
    <ul id="a">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style elelment in the head section</li>
        <li> External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span ><b>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try yourself.</b></span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When compairing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style on one unique element, ID si special in that you use a special URL, to link directly to an element and it's used by javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element on webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p>
       There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
